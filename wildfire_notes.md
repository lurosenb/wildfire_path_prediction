### Research and Assessment:
- A lot of research on mitigating big fire behavior including smoke modeling, social science, fire fighter health, and safety.
- Changes every year, necessitating annual assessments to identify gaps.

### Program Focus:
- Emphasis on maintaining a strong connection to the field.
- Everyone in the office still has ties to on-ground fire management.
- Prioritization given to funding based on size and proximity of fires.

### Wildland Fire Decision Support System:
- A dashboard that is interagency, ensuring unified standards for hiring, training, and tool utilization.
- Special authorization required to use the system.
- Helps determine resource allocation based on fire behavior modeling, fuel conditions, topography, and weather forecasts.
- Projections made on potential fire activities over 1-2 days, especially concerning communities or other vital resources (like watersheds).
- Evaluations include accessibility for firefighters.

### Resource Categorization:
- All resources are categorized (e.g., Type 1 team/crew for complex events) with specialists, aircraft, etc.
- GIS layers depict landscapes, fuel conditions, and locations of at-risk entities. 
- Ratings are determined for aspects like communities, roads, trails, etc. 
- Weather forecasts are pulled from predictive services for analysis.

### Fire Spread and Resource Mobilization:
- Initial response, usually by a local fire department, happens within a few hours.
- Additional resource allocation might take a couple of days.
- Efforts in place to pre-position resources based on upcoming predictions.
- Preparedness levels assigned to every region and evaluated weekly. In high-risk months like June, resource reservation decisions might be accelerated.

### Fire Behavior Models:
- Predominantly rely on Rothermel models, which have known limitations.
- Efforts are ongoing to develop physics-based models.
- Some are attempting to enhance current models using high-resolution weather data.

### Fire Speed and Firefighter Deployment:
- Assessment of the fire's spread rate is crucial to response strategy.
- Flame lengths determine firefighter deployment. If flames exceed 4 feet, deployment becomes unsafe.
- The progression and potential "jumps" of fire are vital.

### Regional Response and Containment:
- Response mechanism varies by fire region.
- Containment is the primary goal for large fires, either by creating barriers or leveraging natural ones like roads.
- In absence of natural barriers, specialized crews dig containment lines ahead of the fire's progression.

### Modeling with BurnPro:
- BurnPro is utilized to predict fire behavior by adjusting physics model constants.
- While models offer insights, they're always supplemented by human experience and expertise.
- Their daily use informs decisions, but everyone is aware of their limitations.

### External Resources and Communication:
- WiFire Group: [Commons](https://wifire.ucsd.edu/commons) and [Next-Generation Models](https://wifire.ucsd.edu/next-generation-models).
- Focus on improving fire detection data usage.
- Emphasis on aligning data with public concerns, especially regarding community evacuations.
- Efforts are underway to better communicate potential fire spreads to vulnerable communities.
